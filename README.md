# My Personal Website

visit live site [here](http://melissamartinez.me)

This is my personal website to act as a visual resume and to display my projects. Iâ€™m started this site off as basic static webpage using Rails so that I can later add dynamic content like an email submission form and also implement a personal blog to the site. I decided on a modular design so that I can easily add or remove sections as needed in the future. I also utilized SASS variables to be able to easily change the theme in the future.  

***Tools Used:***
-	HTML5, SASS, Javascript
-	Ruby on Rails
-	Heroku
